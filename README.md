Make sure to make your own branch and push your code there, then later we can merge on Main. 

Handling the data structure: 

Install dependencies: 
```
make install 
or 
brew install cryptography
```
I would suggest using brew to install the dependencies, since the makefile will be changing. 

Also to initialize the blockchain, run: 
```
init 
```
and to show the blockchain, run: 
```
show 
```
