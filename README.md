This project required us to create a command-line interface (CLI) that interacts with a blockchain system specifically designed for the chain of custody in digital forensics. The blockchain needed to support several core operations, such as init, log, add and verify.

Handling the data structure: 

Install dependencies: 
```
make install 
or 
brew install cryptography
```
I would suggest using brew to install the dependencies, since the makefile will be changing. 

The version of crytogrphy used is 3.4.8. 
if testing on linux use pycryptodome instead of cryptography.
